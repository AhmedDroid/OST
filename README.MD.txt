# Project structure
This project is using modular android application with Model-View-ViewModel architecture

# Documentation / comments
I believe that private projects doesn't need any documentation as long as the code is clean because the clean code should explain it self.

# Android Clean Architecture
I believe that clean architecture is the new standard for Android projects,
and while I provide the minimum amount of separation between modules this shows my skills and knowledge in non-monolithic module based projects, yet keeping it simple.
